
# BMP to PNG with transparent Color
-----

## How it works?<br>
1. Run BmpToPng.exe (32Bit Windows).<br>
2. Drag-Drop a .bmp(24bit) file for windows.<br>
3. Use LeftClick to set the color you want to make transparent.<br>
4. Use RightClick to Save the image as .png.<br>
5. The App will EXIT when DONE.<br>

## Build.
_for beginners_ <br>
1.Download [DevCpp_v4.9.9.*](http://www.bloodshed.net/) and install it.<br>
2.Run build.bat (it works only with Dev-C++ 4.9.9.*).<br>
_others_ <br>
You already know how to rebuilt it. ^_^<br>
<br>

# NOTE
*It uses libs(png & zlib).<br>
*I use it to convert BMP file to PNG,then PNG to ICO(I need ICO for my Apps).<br>
